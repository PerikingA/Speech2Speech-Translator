the way the web app works is this:

1) user selects language 1
2) user selects language 2
3) user speaks into the mic in the language 1
4) speech text, lang1, and lang2 gets passed to translation app on python
5) translation app receives the text from lang1 and translates it to lang2
6) translation app passes translated text and lang2 to the text_to_speech app
7) the text to speech app speaks the text
